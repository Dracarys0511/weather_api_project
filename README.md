# Weather_Api_Project

# Description
This code makes an API request to the weather API [(openweathermap.org)] with the API key and the location whose weather we need to know. The API response is received in .JSON format, which is then formatted to display the weather information about the location we entered earlier legibly as output.

After this, a .TXT file is generated containing the same output that we received after running the code for future reference. The contents of the .TXT file are altered everytime as soon as we perform a subsequent run of the code.
